## About

- **Long Bio:**

  *Who is Erik Martus?*

  Short answer: he is me, I am he.

  Long answer: I am a web designer/developer and graphic designer currently based out of Philadelphia, PA, though I hail from Massachusetts. I got my start in design at Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational Technical High School, which yes, was a nightmare to write on standarized tests, though it is locally known as BVT.

  I am currently a sophomore at Drexel University majoring in Interactive Digital Media (IDM). For one reason or another I came to the conclusion that that is just not enough work, so I am double minoring in Psychology and Graphic Design. I am fascinated by how people think and strive to bring psychological concepts into my work with the goal of creating seamless user experiences, and then I just find graphic design fun and intriguing.

  My current concentration is in web design and development, though I am looking forward to delving into User Experience in the coming terms. ***Write More***

  I currently work as a student ambassador for Drexel University providing tours to prospective students and their parents, and discussing student life with them and what they could expect should they choose to attend the university. Additionally, I am the graphic designer for DrexelCHI, Drexel's chapter of SIGCHI for which I produce advertising materials for events and guest speakers.

  Though I am a designer, I am a human first, get to know me:

### - Reve

- **Description:**

  For the final project for Design II for Media, a freshmen level course at Drexel University, I worked together with Brianna Buissereth **(INCLUDE LINK)** to develop an animation that further explored one of the color theory topics we learned about throughout the course. Our animation dealt with monochromatic color schemes and evoking emotions based on them.

  The story follows Fille, a young girl who wakes up in a dark wood. As she explores her surroundings, a cloud-like monster called Nuage appears and chases her. Eventually Fille reaches the end of the woods, but finds herself backed up against the edge of a cliff that she stumbles off of as the piece ends, leaving what happens to her up to the interpretation of the viewer.

  Brianna headed up character design and the unique world objects and backgrounds, while I was the primary animator and I developed the look and feel for the trees scattered about the forest. All of the animation was completed in Adobe After Effects where we experimented with the paralax effect we could create by enabling 3D space within the composition. We were able to bring Fille to life thanks to a plug-in for After Effects called DUIK **(INCLUDE LINK)** that allowed us to rig our assets brought in from Adobe Illustrator. Nuage was interesting to develop as the only asset that we really developed were his eyes, everything else for his character is handled by a particle fountain inside of Adobe After Effects that allows his form to take on a more mystical and constantly changing appearance.

### - Summit Connect Portal Redesign

- **Description:**

  Final project for the IDM 211: User Interface I course at Drexel University.

  I was tasked with selecting a website that needed a redesign either because its appearence was underwhelming or because the content was structured in a way that made it difficult for users to accomplish the task they were using the site for.

  The website I selected was the Connect Portal utilized by American Campus Communities for their residents to pay rent, submit maintainence requests, and other rental information. I chose to approach the project as if each living community would have a stylized version of the site that would match that communities appearence and aestethics. As I lived in the Summit at University City I focused on styling the redesign for that community.

  Over the ten week course I had to identify the core content of the existing site and why its current state made it difficult for users to accomplish the main task of the website, paying rent to Summit. Following this, I produced redesigns that would more purposefully suit this task while also being more aestethically pleasing for users. Once the finaly design was chosen, a prototype was built in Adobe XD that would showcase a streamlined user workflow.

- **Media:**
  - Redacted screenshots of current site
  - Sketches of redesign
  - Rounds of prototypes
  - Final prototype (permalink if possible)

- **Programs:**
  - Adobe XD

### - Hair dryer model (if I can find the turntable)

- **Description:**

  Final project for ANIM 140: Computer Graphics Imagery I at Drexel University.

  This project was to construct and texture a 3D model in Autodesk Maya. The object could be anything so long as it was an "electric appliance", which is a very vague way of saying some sort of complex electronic device. This foray in the realm of 3D modeling was a stressful and complicated stray out of my comort zone, but ultimately was a great learning experience.

  Of the initial objects I submitted, my professor selected the hair dryer I grabbed from a friend on a whim. This kicked off an eight week ordeal of learning how to work in a 3D environment and a constant reminder of the allpowerful space bar in Maya that I subconsciously kept pressing out of habit from Adobe products to move around, but instead kept destroying my viewport.

  Once the model was carefully and painstakingly constructed through extrusions, merges, and manipulations of edges and vertices textures were produced in Adobe Photoshop. These were produced through creating UVs and exporting the UV layout to Photoshop and then brought back into Maya upon completion.

  Ultimately, while 3D modeling is a skill I doubt I will have to utlize much in my future, this project was a great lesson in patience and time management that has become invaluable in projects that I have worked on since then.
