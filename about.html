                <h3>Short answer: he is me, I am he.</h3>

                <p><strong>Long answer:</strong> I am a web designer/developer and graphic designer currently based out
                    of Philadelphia, PA, though I hail from Massachusetts. I got my start in design at Blackstone Valley
                    Regional Vocational Technical High School, which yes, was a nightmare to write on standarized tests,
                    though it is locally known as BVT.</p>
                <p>I am currently a sophomore at Drexel University majoring in Interactive Digital Media (IDM). For one
                    reason or another I came to the conclusion that that is just not enough work, so I am double
                    minoring in Psychology and Graphic Design. I am fascinated by how people think and strive to bring
                    psychological concepts into my work with the goal of creating seamless user experiences, and then I
                    just find graphic design fun and intriguing.</p>
                <p>My current concentration is in web design and development, though I am looking forward to delving
                    into User Experience in the coming terms.</p>
                <p>I currently work as a student ambassador for Drexel University providing tours to prospective
                    students and their parents, and discussing student life with them and what they could expect should
                    they choose to attend the university. Additionally, I am the graphic designer for DrexelCHI,
                    Drexel's chapter of SIGCHI for which I produce advertising materials for events and guest speakers.
