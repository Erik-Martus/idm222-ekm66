                <h3>Short answer: he is me, I am he.</h3>

                <p><strong>Long answer:</strong> I am a web designer/developer and graphic designer currently based out of Philadelphia, PA, though I hail from Massachusetts. I got my start in design at Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational Technical High School, which yes, was a nightmare to write on standarized tests, though it is locally known as BVT.</p>
                <p>I am currently a sophomore at Drexel University majoring in Interactive Digital Media (IDM). For one reason or another I came to the conclusion that that is just not enough work, so I am double minoring in Psychology and Graphic Design. I am fascinated by how people think and strive to bring psychological concepts into my work with the goal of creating seamless user experiences, and then I just find graphic design fun and intriguing.</p>
                <p>My current concentration is in web design and development, though I am looking forward to delving into User Experience in the coming terms.</p>
                <p>I currently work as a student ambassador for Drexel University providing tours to prospective students and their parents, and discussing student life with them and what they could expect should they choose to attend the university. Additionally, I am the graphic designer for DrexelCHI, Drexel's chapter of SIGCHI for which I produce advertising materials for events and guest speakers.</p>
